Ever think that some Mega Evolutions are too weak. Well, this datapack fixes it by buffing them.

Required mods:
  Cobblemon(https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon) >= 1.6.1
  Mega Showdown(https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-mega-showdown) >= 9.0.0

I tried override the existing data of the Megas to achive my goal, but I cannot get it to work. If you ever found a way to do so, please fork this project to let me know. 
This datapack basically just adds new Fakemons of the Megas I have tweaked. To change between forms, right click Pokemon with a empty Mega Stone (I will change this to their own Mega Stones later).
